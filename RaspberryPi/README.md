## About

Edublocks is a block based programming language for the raspberry pi that makes the transition between Scratch and Python easier.

Edublocks is developed and maintained by [AllAboutCode](https://github.com/AllAboutCode/EduBlocks). You can download and read more about it here [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org)

Within this repo you will find code snippets for EduBlocks. These are bits of code that I base tutorials around for DundeeRJam.
